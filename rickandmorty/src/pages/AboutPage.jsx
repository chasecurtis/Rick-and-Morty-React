      <h1>About Rick and Morty:</h1>
      <p>
        Rick and Morty hurtles you head-first into a universe (well, dozens of
        ’em) where nothing is off-limits and every wild idea gets aired out in
        the funniest, smartest possible way. At its core is Rick
        Sanchez—brilliant, reckless, and refreshingly brutal about the hard
        truths of existence—and his perpetually mortified grandson Morty, whose
        dim-but-earnest heart keeps their interdimensional misadventures from
        veering into total nihilism. Equal parts laugh-out-loud comedy and
        razor-sharp sci-fi satire, the show challenges you to question reality,
        morality, and the very meaning of “family” while never letting up on the
        chaos. If you’re ready for unapologetic humor, mind-bending twists, and
        moments of genuine emotional punch, Rick and Morty is your portal to
        infinite possibilities—and infinite fun.
